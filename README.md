## About Me
My name is Erika Harvey and I was born and raised in central Florida. I have had many jobs in my past including, dance educator, online business owner, and Disney headband maker, but ultimately I'm looking forward to persuing a career in web design upon completion of my masters. Additionally, I love spending time with my husband, 9 year-old daughter, and dog named  Jasper!

## Past Coding Experience
I have absolutely no experience in coding except for the very little experience I gained while coding a MySpace profile to my liking back in the early 2000's.

## Career Goals
1. Attain a career in web design (hoping to hone in on my area of expertise through my master's program)
2. Become an accomplished web desiner
3. Retire!
